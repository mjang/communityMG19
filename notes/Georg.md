## Dawn Foster: Strategies to Balance the Needs of the Company and the Community

- Contributions come from individuals
  - unless they use company emails, you cannot tell who they work from
  - community responsibilities go with individuals when they change companies

- Companies cannot directly contribute
  - Companies can dedicate employee's time for contributing
  - hire someone already contributing

- communities
  - contains a wide variety of people with different skills and Contributions
  - it's a small world, be kind to others, your reputation is important
  - companies should do due dilligent on how someone behaved in the past

- Contribution Strategy and Plan
  - make sure the open source strategy aligns with business goals
  - employees need to understand the impact their work is having 

- which projects to contribut to (company strategy)
  - projects that are already being used in company in ops, product development, and other areas.
  - existing Contributions

- after deciding on projects, company needs to determine what resources are required
  - money required for membership and influence?
  - people required to work on project
  - hiring (carefully) 
  - guidelines and processes are important but have to be easy to understand and encouraging (not focus on legal language or consequences)

- measure success requires data and metrics
  - what to measure "depends on what you want to achieve"
  - the plan for open source has to drive the selection of metrics
  - CHAOSS provides a set of common metrics and tools to use

- Getting started
  - join, introduce yourself, read the docs
  - start small with small Contributions
  - have early conversations
  - lurk, learn the process, and maybe start with bug fixes first to learn more

- learn from feedback, expect feedback
  - feedback can be kind or hars. either way, stay kind and make adjustments
  - have others review your response to make sure it is not overly harsh
  - what ever you post will reflect on you and your employer
  - allow for enough time to iterate

- work with the community to align feature expectations and partner with others working on the same issues
  - break changes into smaller chunks because it is easier to provide feedback for and to fix issues with
  - recognize that you do not have any control over other community members

- attend events and meet people in person
  - online communication gets easier when you know the other person
  - build a network of people who can help you

- contribute upstream
  - may be a little more work upfront, but benefits others and reduces maintenance in the future
  - expect to continue maintaining your contributions

- open source for the right reasons
  - not because it is no longer of interest
  - do release for wanting to collaborate
  - be prepared to continue maintaining
  - do release to get feedback and build community
  - expect extra time for community building (time for incoming pull requests)
  - prepare employees to provide tough but kind feedback (best effort)

## Josh Berkus - What Sponsors want

- It is not very effective to beg for money for events or communities

- Sponsorship is an exchange, a sale
  - you get:
    - money
    - endorsement
    - discounts
    - advertising
    - marketing
    - speakers
    - attendees
    - content
  - sponsors get:
    - exposure
    - association
    - sales
    - recruiting

- Exposure is the first and most important and always given
  - logo on everything (! not the only exposure they are looking for)
  - maybe company just wants to expose their brand in general
  - maybe there is a particular product or initiative they want to expose and promote
    - When talking with a potential sponsor: suggest that a certain product or initiative could be a good fit for exposure at your event
  - exposure can be on 
    - website
    - your communications
    - signage at the conference
    - thank you announcements
    - booth/table
  - additional exposure opportunities (temporary "make your logo larger than everyone's else")
    - branded items (tshirts, lanyards)
    - branded sub-events (luncheons)
    - branded scholarships

- Association 
  - want to associate company name with the community name
  - association is a two-way street - also includes negative association. E.g. negative press for a community can lead to sponsor pull-out

- sales and recruitment
  - sponsors staff booths for 2 reasons
    1. to _sell_ a product or service
    2. to _recruit_ employees, partners, or others (contributors for their communities)

- when sponsorship is an exchange, then follow the money and identify who to sell to. In companies that is typically
  - Largest budgets are in marketing
  - Localized events are more likely to succeed with the sales department
  - HR
  - need to talk in the terms of the target audience

- persuading most important is through the Prospectus
  - lays out what sponsors get and how much it costs
  - needs to have a sales pitch for community/event
  - dates and location
  - attendee demographics
  - sponsorship opportunities (sponsorship levels, cost)
  - additional sponsorship opportunities

- REDUCE TRANSACTIONAL FRICTION: make it easier
  - publicly downloadable preospectus
  - credit card payments online
    - make it easy to sponsor, without human interaction
  - *combine several events per year into one prospectus*

- other tips
  - prospectus year + in advance, get ahead of budgeting in organizations
  - keep sonsorship tiers stable across events, to allow planning and budgeting
  - be responsive, do not exceed deadlines within companies
  - have someone dedicated to dealing with paperwork
  - coordinate between departments (often independent budgets within same company), that can increase the sponsorship amount possible
  - be aggressive in solicitiung your corporate contacts as far in advance as you can - as soon as you do planning and know
  - best to approach a company during the annual budget planning time for following budget cycle; or during end of budget cycle for them to spend remaining budget


## Kristof Van Tomme - From Purpose to Value and back again: Communities as living systems

- Purpose is like water in your hands: the harder you squeeze, the more it gets away
- There seems to be no process to finding a purpose or any understanding for how it works
- "Purpose is in our personal & cultural blind spot"

- So, what is purpose?
  - "What is the purpose of a bumblebee?"
    - its a living system that wants to stay alive and do its thing
  - "What is the purpose of a hammer?"
    - It does not have a purpose in itself. It makes only sense in relation to it's users.
  - The secret is in its relation to a self

- Living systems (like communities) do self-work (3 key processes)
  - self-repair
  - self-replication
  - self-protection

- A community can become a self, but not if all self-work is done for it (self-work has to be done within the community)
  - pump system requires constant input from outside

- Self-work requires constraining sponeneous reactions 
  - cannot predict all interactions with environments, but has rules what is allowed

- complicated systems (e.g., watch) vs. complex systems (e.g., living beings)
  - complicated systems break down if the working conditions are not met
  - complex systems stay adaptive and can become resilient

- Constraints are non-deterministic, open boundaries that leave freedom
  - example of a violin instrument, that allows for certain frequencies but enables a lot of freedom
  1. A set of constraints can become an affordance - for example a platform
  2. The boundary of a self is a key constraint at which it senses & selects
    - A self needs a set of differentiated constraints that allow to take in resouces from the environment
  3. These constraints form an identiy that should be somewhat unique to prevent unnecessary competition
    - just sufficiently different identity from others, but it is not all about survival of the fittest (avoid competition through differentiation)
    - Correlating constraints (between people, organizations, and communities) enable trust through te recognition of archetypes. 

- most often, Value = purpose + scarcity (e.g., for money)
  - transactional exchanges remove obligations and create freedoms, but dissolves our bonds 

- Values also exist in other forms
  - social constraints of a community

- There is an aspect to purpose that transcends individuals
  - when we resonate with a community and others
  - e.g., religion, activism, community, 
  - A problem with pursuing a larger purpose is that we loose sight of our own purpose and the larger purpose is only good for the larger good, not for the individual.

- Healthy Purpose is fractal: purpose that returns throughout all the systems we participate in.
  - we need to create fractal purpose for our communities: do not threaten indidivual purpose but allow for collaboration on shared purposes

- Strange loops
  - when the constraints of our intersectional identity come together

- Open source can be thought of as a fire, not a living system that self-protects
  - fires are energy emmitting that burns through the fuel
  - open source does not have clear self-boundaries and are setup to burn through any resources that touch it, including people, organizations, and venture capital

- living systems work with constraints
  - at some point, they build affordances that free up resources and make the system better
  - this is not a road map or blue print. affordances are created as the result of working within boundaries


## Manrique LÃ³pez- Improving companies relationship with open source communities

- Digital transformation is increasing the focus on software in organizations
- Open source, when considered as a vendor, is the largest provider of software in orgs
- A lot of work is done in communities and companies need to manage their relationships with these communities
- The communities are complex ecosystems with many different projects and people work across these projects.
- Managing the relationships with open source communities is discussed in many fora, including the TODO Group. Getting started guides help avoid pitfalls.
- Companies have many different questions about open source communities
- Looking at data can answer some questions, but when you start collecting data, then people typically feel like they drown in data
- "Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat" - Sun Tzu
  - You need to know what questions to ask of the data and what metrics to look at for what purposes.
- Metrics is often ad-hoc because there is no framework for community health metrics
  - The Linux Foundation's CHAOSS project is working on creating a framework for metrics.
- Start metrics strategy from your business goals, then dtermine the questions for achieving the goals, finally determine metrics to answer the questions.

Advice for coming up with questions, when you know your goals?
- In the CHAOSS project, frequently asked questions are documented and are made available - discussion occurs on mailing list and conference call.
- Correlation vs. causality: you need to understand what contributes to your goals.

Any work on Anti-metrics - metrics that should not be used?
- Also called as "vanity metrics".
- "You are what you measure." - Measure what you want to improve on.
  - Corrolary: If you have a metric for something that you do not care about, it will still drive behavior.
    - E.g., Kubernetes removed all "lines of code" metrics.
